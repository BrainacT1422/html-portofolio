<h1>About Seraphim E-sport</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, Seraphim E-sport here!!</p>
<p>Seraphim E-Sport was first founded by Wolfsbane-v1 while playing the online game Audition Ayodance. At that time, he saw a club with members who were very close to each other, so he thought about starting his own club containing his friends. He founded Seraphim E-Sport with his close friend since he was still an embryo, namely Sparkslight- who has only lived in this game since birth.</p>
<p>Since it was created on February 21 2013, the first member to join was BrainacT. He is a very ordinary member, polite towards others and never says anything rude. Since he joined, only BrainacT has been very normal in this club.</p>
<p>And after several years since it was created, Seraphim, which was previously only a small club consisting of 3 people, has now developed into an organization that is active in the world of E-Sport so that it is now also called SERAPHIM E-Sport.</p>
